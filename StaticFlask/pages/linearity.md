title: Linearity in Quantum Physics

This is kind of a *thorny* topic; my understanding of it gets slightly tenuous as we extend to interacting systems but I'm going to give it my best shot!

Linearity is a concept you should intuitively be familiar with from Secondary School Physics, thougn it's almost certain it was never formally explaiend. Recall the principle of using the 'Centre of Mass' in Newtonian Physics. A star, a person, a football; all are, as we know, made up of an enormous number of atoms, all moving around and interacting with each other. Given the huge number of object and interactions we need to track, how can we hope to describe what happens if we, say, push a ball? We have a bunch of different forces ac....

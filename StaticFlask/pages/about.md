title: 'Hello there'

My name's Padraic. I'm a physics student, mostly, currently a student at the [UCL Centre for Doctoral Training in Delivering Quantum Technologies](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/quantum).

What are quantum technologies, you ask? Good question. That's something I hope to explore on this site. My interests lie mostly in the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, and Quantum Information Processing, but I'd like to look into explaining some other qauntum devices too. 

I say physics mostly because I can just about eke out some spare time. The only hobby I really keep up these days is the odd spot of coding. Sometimes this results in a tangible project, like this site, or something more complete like [voXup](voxup.co.uk).

I'd broadly say I'm a huge dork. I somehow keep up with technology without really meaning too, and I usually have headphones on my person for music or podcasts. I'll be more than happy to talk for far too long about either. 

Back when I was at Imperial College I did some writing and editing for [Felix](felixonline.co.uk/user/phc11/), and some radio shows/IT managing for [IC Radio](icradio.com/shows/787). I hope to do the same here at UCL when I find the time.

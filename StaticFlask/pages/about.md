title: 'Hello there'

My name's Padaric. I'm a physics student, mostly, currently a student at the [UCL Centre for Doctoral Training in Delivering Quantum Technologies](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/quantum).

What are quantum technologies, you ask? Good question. That's something I hope to explore on this site.

Static Flask
===========

This is a small project to create a Jekyll-like blogging tool using markdown formatted pages and Flask, to be run as a personal blog. As such it also includes `py-markdown-math` for escaping LaTeX commands in Markdown.

StaticFlask is a configurable, 'batteries included' Blueprint.

## Possible Extensions / Refinements

The core refinement I would like is to package StaticFlask and create a simple command-wrapper. This would initialize a directly with config and (skeleton) template files and (optionally) the raw site code, to enable others to create websites with Static Flask.

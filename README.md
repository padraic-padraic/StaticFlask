Static Flask
===========

This is a small project to create a Jekyll-like blogging tool using markdown formatted pages and Flask, to be run as a personal blog. As such it also includes MathJax support for rendering Latex. 

Eventually, I would like to make it extensible to work like a little Flask-based CMS, but we'll see how much time I have.
